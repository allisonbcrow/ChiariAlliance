        <p>
          This website is for those living with Chiari malformation — and the families and
          friends who support them — information and support are vital in
          understanding the conditions and making the best treatment and
          lifestyle decisions.

        <p>Chiari Malformation is a serious neurological disorder where the bottom part of the brain, the cerebellum, descends out of the skull and crowds the spinal cord, putting pressure on both the brain and spine and causing many symptoms.</p>
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Signature symptom is a severe headache in the back of
the head brought on by straining, coughing, etc.</li>
          <li>
          It is not known why but symptoms can develop at any
age
          </li>
          <li>Trauma may play a role in sparking symptoms</li>
          <li>
          Symptoms are believed to be due to compression of
brain and spinal tissue, disruption of the natural flow
cerebrospinal fluid, and increased pressure in the brain
          </li>
          <li>
           Recent and ongoing research is beginning to
characterize the cognitive and psychological effects of
Chiari
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no single, objective,
definitive test for symptomatic
Chiari. Diagnosis is based on a
combination of factors and is an
informed opinion on whether
symptoms are due to herniated
cerebellar tonsils</li>
          <li>
          Chiari is often missed and misdiagnosed as other diseases
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Only treatment which addresses underlying problem is surgery
</li>
          <li>
          Treatment decision is based on whether symptoms are clearly
due to Chiari and bad enough to warrant surgery
          </li>
          <li>No objective test or criteria to say when a patient should have
surgery

</li>
          <li>
          Since surgery is the primary treatment option, most patients see
a neurosurgeon for treatment opinions

          </li>
          <li>Only about half (or less) of patients evaluated are recommended
for surgery</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Related Conditions</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Syringomyelia</li>
         <li>Ehlers Danlos Syndrome</li>
         <li>Pseudotumor Cerebri</li>
         <li>Hydrocephalus</li>
